# sv-kubernetes changelog

## 8/8/2019

* Upgrade Kubernetes from `1.11 -> 1.13.7`
* Increase box memory from `2 GB -> 4 GB`
* Increase box cpu from `1 cpu -> 2 cpus`
* Upgrade minikube version from `v0.30.0 -> v1.3.0`
* Upgrade kubectl version from `1.11.0 -> 1.13.7`

## 7/10/2019

* Breaking change to how secrets are managed. `secrets_key` must now be added to the settings.yaml. See the secrets docs for more info.

## 7/5/2019

* Adds ability to pass `--build-arg` to `sv start` to pass custom docker build args.
* `sv start` will now automatically pass a `SV_ENV=env` build arg to all builds allowing Dockerfile's to have conditional behavior based on the env. Please use this with caution as different builds based on environment, by definition, introduce differnces between environments.

## 5/8/2019

* Adds `sv restartPod` to restart one pod in an application.

## 4/30/2019

* In the test environment we can now run multiple pull requests at the same time by giving them each a unique application name via the `--alias` flag. If you need to know the name of the deployed app you can access the `sv.deploymentName` variable in your helm chart.

## 4/12/2019

* Adds support for applications to have dependencies to allow installing/updating an app and all of it's dependencies in one call.

## 4/10/2019

* Added support for `settings.buildOrder` for handling multi-step docker builds.
* Added support for `settings.dockerBase`.

## 4/3/2019

* Added `sv script` for executing scripts within your repositories.
* Added `sv copyFrom` for copying files out of running containers.

## 3/14/2019

* Adds a mechanic to verify if the sv-kubernetes installation is out of date, ran when executing `sv` commands.

## 3/13/2019

* Updates the `sv install` command to update a checkout if it already exists as well as support switching to the proper remote/branch.

## 3/5/2019

* Adds dnsmasq to sv-kubernetes to improve performance of building docker containers and dns lookups OUTSIDE the kubernetes env.

## 3/1/2019

* Attempts to fix DNS delay issues by utilizing a kube-dns config map to bypass the VirtualBox dns routing which appears to cause delays.

## 2/11/2019

* `sv-local-proxy` is now `sv-kube-proxy` since it will be utilized in other environments to handle proxying requests and SSL termination.

## 1/27/2019

* `sv test` now requires the container to have `metadata.annotations.sv-test-command` to declare the test command.

## 1/17/2019

* Changes the way the github authentication works. Previously it was using the token, now it's using the ssh key file to allow submodules to work better.

## 11/28/2018

* Switching from utilizing separate repos for each container and moving to put the container repo within the application folder.
* Deprecated the `settings.yaml` capability, it is no longer required based on moving the repos.

## 11/15/2018

* sv-kubernetes system refactored to built on a Ubuntu box instead of Centos.
* Build scripts re-engineered so that the main `setup.sh` can be executed multiple times to update all necessary pieces.
* Build scripts split into sub-scripts to allow them to be executed individually when the time arises.
* `settings.yaml` file can now be placed in the root of your application helm repo and specify an array of containers. Each container will be cloned down on a `sv install`, in addition the containers can be auto-build when running `sv start`
* `sv restart` removed and replace with `--build`.
* `sv start app env --build` will now build all containers specified in the `settings.yaml` file.
